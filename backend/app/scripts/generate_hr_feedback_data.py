generate_hr_feedback_data.py

Generates dummy "HR Feedback" data -- real HR/PM performance review check-ins
on an employee's work on a specific real project, tied to real (employee,
project) pairs drawn from the real allocation data (never invented pairs),
reviewed by a real employee (the project's real reporter/approver, or the
employee's real manager -- never an invented name), grounded in the project's
real tech CoE. The hackathon team never provided real feedback records, so
this mirrors the same posture as weekly_pulse_generator.py: a clearly-labeled
synthetic dataset, grounded in real staffing/org data rather than random
employee/project pairs or fabricated reviewer identities.

Each review reads like a real short performance write-up: 1-3 themes, each
with a "Positives" paragraph and an "Areas for Growth" paragraph, wrapped in a
greeting/sign-off -- not a single generic one-line comment.

Logic:
  - Read the real allocations + projects + employees CSVs.
  - For each allocation row with a real start/end date and a duration of at
    least MIN_DURATION_DAYS, generate periodic HR check-ins roughly every
    CHECKIN_INTERVAL_WEEKS, up to MAX_FEEDBACK_PER_ALLOCATION per allocation --
    capped at "today" so nothing is dated in the future, and never more than
    a few weeks past the allocation's own end date.
  - The reviewer is a real employee: the project's real reporter_employee_id,
    falling back to approver_employee_id, falling back to the reviewed
    employee's own manager_employee_id -- never fabricated.
  - Ratings are randomized on a 1-5 scale but weighted to look like a real
    review distribution (mostly positive), with a per-employee "sentiment
    bias" (same deterministic hash-based technique as weekly_pulse_generator)
    so a given employee's feedback reads consistently across their projects
    instead of pure per-row noise.
