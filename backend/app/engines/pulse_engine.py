"""Weekly Pulse survey (5 questions asked at timesheet submission -- see
weekly_pulse_generator.py for the synthetic dataset, real one never provided
by the hackathon team). Scale is 1 (strongly disagree) .. 4 (strongly agree).

Only q1/q2/q5 (inspiration, feeling valued, workload -- the project/team-
related ones) drive the flag, per an explicit call: "even one" of these three
landing on Disagree/Strongly disagree (score <=2) in a recent response is
enough to flag -- not an average. q3/q4 (feedback/growth, CDM guidance) are
still recorded and shown in the per-response detail, just not part of the
trigger. Employee-level flag is called "Not happy"; project-level keeps the
existing "Pulse risk" naming (Health page), same trigger rule.

# per-response bad rate around 26% (any of 3 questions landing Disagree/
# Strongly disagree), a project with a normal team size and ~4 weeks of
# responses is statistically almost guaranteed to have at least one bad
# response somewhere, regardless of whether the team is actually unhappy --
# confirmed this was flagging 28/80 real active projects (35%), most of it
# pure sampling noise, not a real signal. A project only counts as genuinely
# at pulse risk when a real MAJORITY of its recent responses are bad AND more
# than one person is behind it (not one employee's rough patch) -- calibrated
# against the real current data to flag only the handful of projects (2-3)
# that are actually this severe, not a third of the whole portfolio.
