"""Fallback required-skills inference for pipeline demand rows that have no
real skillset text of their own.

~53% of real pipeline_forecast rows (156/293) have a blank `skillset` field --
HubSpot deals where nobody typed a skills list. Left alone, every candidate
for that role scores bucket="not_assessed" (ranked by availability/competency
only) and AI Semantic Match short-circuits with "no skillset". This module
infers a real, defensible required-skills list instead, in priority order:

  1. The deal's real `solution` field (proposition_coe vocabulary) is bridged
     to a canonical tech_coe via real historical COMPLETE/ACTIVE projects that
     share that same real proposition_coe (majority vote) -- the same
     real-data bridge experience_engine.py uses per-employee, aggregated here
     at the population level instead. That canonical CoE's real, curated
     skill list (COE_Skills_Mapping.csv) becomes the inferred skillset.
  2. When no solution is set, or it doesn't resolve to any canonical CoE with
     real project history, the same sentence-transformer embedding model used
     for AI Semantic Match / semantic skill scoring elsewhere in this app
     picks the nearest-matching CoE by comparing whatever real text IS on the
     row (decoded role code + comments) against each CoE's real skill list --
     "closest matching skills we could find", explicitly labeled as such.
  3. If there's truly nothing to go on (embedding unavailable, or no CoE
     clears the minimum similarity bar), the Cross-Functional/Core Consulting
     Skills row from COE_Skills_Mapping.csv -- the org's own real
     "applies to every CoE" baseline -- is the last resort.

Every inference carries a `source`/`confidence` field so callers/UI never
present this as if HubSpot/the deal author specified it themselves.
