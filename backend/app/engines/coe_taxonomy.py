"""Canonical CoE vocabulary and alias resolution.

CoE labels flow in from multiple sources -- the employee roster's home-CoE
field (skills df "coe" column, canonicalized via COE_SKILL_MAP in
coe_skill_engine.py), the pipeline skillset reference sheet's coe_skill
column, and free-text solution/tech_coe labels on deals -- and none of them
are guaranteed to use the same literal strings (e.g. "Data Science & AI" vs
"AI & ML" vs "Gen AI" all mean the same CoE).

COE_SKILL_MAP is the authoritative, maintained mapping (same one
employee_coe.py canonicalizes against), so it always wins on overlap here.
_SUPPLEMENTARY_ALIASES only fills in variants seen in OTHER sources that
COE_SKILL_MAP doesn't cover at all -- e.g. "TechOps and MS" is a
tech_coe/project-label spelling (see SKILLSET_CATEGORY_TO_TECH_COE in
recommendation_service.py), a different namespace than skill_coe, so it
won't ever show up in COE_SKILL_MAP itself. Add entries here as new
spellings turn up in non-skill_coe sources, rather than patching individual
comparisons elsewhere in the codebase.

Run this file directly (`python -m app.engines.coe_taxonomy`) to audit the
live data for any CoE-ish label that still doesn't resolve to one of the 5
canonical categories -- this is how new unmapped spellings (like the
"TechOps and Automation" / "Platform Engineering" cases) get caught before
they cause a silent ranking miss, instead of waiting for someone to notice
a wrong recommendation in the UI.
