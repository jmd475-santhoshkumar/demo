"""This week's "Top Projects -- End to End Review" for a cluster (the JQA
deck's spotlight table: Project | DevOps Visibility | Milestone Visibility |
Comments | Action Plan). The deck's Score Card column (a numeric rating like
"DevOps - 4.5/5") was dropped -- it mostly restated the WSR badge/Comments
already shown, so it wasn't worth its own manual field.

Defaults to the top 5 projects in the cluster by real risk_score (same
score already driving the main Health table's default sort) -- the real deck
doesn't pick these by a visible rule, but showing nothing until someone
manually curates it isn't a useful default either, and "highest real risk
first" is the closest honest proxy: the projects most likely to actually
need this week's governance attention. Fully overridable per project per
week: an explicit "excluded" mark drops an auto-picked project out, an
explicit "included" mark (via Add Project) pulls in one that isn't in the
real top 5. Action Plan (the only genuinely manual field -- see
governance_service.compute_delivery_signals for why DevOps Visibility/
Milestone Visibility/Comments aren't stored here at all) can be attached to
either kind of row.

Composite-keyed on (project_code, week_start_date) so each week's overrides/
notes stand on their own and past weeks are preserved automatically, even
though this first version only ever reads/writes the current week."""
