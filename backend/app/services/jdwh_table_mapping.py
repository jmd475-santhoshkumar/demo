"""Column-mapping from the real JIN Data Warehouse's 6 provisioned tables
(core.employee, core.designation_history, core.project, core.project_allocation,
core.timesheet, core.weekly_status_report -- see jdwh_connection_service.py)
onto this app's existing local data model (the same shape db.py already
loads from data/Transformed/*.csv, so every downstream engine keeps working
unchanged regardless of which source populated it).

Built and validated against a real (partially masked) UAT sample the data
team provided -- see backend/jin_uat_data.ods -- not against production.
Three real data-quality issues were confirmed in that sample and are handled
defensively here (never crash, coerce to null/best-effort instead):

1. Mixed date formats within the same column ("2025-02-06 00:00:00" next to
   "7/22/2024" in the same employee.date_of_join column) -- _parse_date()
   uses pandas' flexible parser rather than a fixed format.
2. `date_of_resignation` uses a literal sentinel "12/31/2999" for "still
   employed" instead of NULL -- must be converted to a real null, not passed
   through as a fake future resignation date.
3. Several `datetime2(7)`-typed audit columns (employee.updated_at,
   project.project_start_date/end_date, valid_from/valid_to) came through
   the sample export with only a time-of-day fragment and no date at all
   (e.g. "00:52:39", "00:00:00") -- these are dropped as unreliable rather
   than mapped; nothing in this app's engines actually needs them, so the
   safest move is to not carry a corrupted date forward as if it were real.
   Whether this is specific to how the UAT sample was generated or a real
   production quirk is unconfirmed -- worth re-checking once real data flows
   through this path.

Every JDWH id column that's a UUID (employee.employee_id, employee.jin_employee_id,
manager_id, reporter_id, approver_id, project.project_id, etc.) gets resolved
to this app's own code-style identifiers (employee_id like "EMP1",
project_code like "GCC_005") via the lookup tables built below -- this app's
existing engines match on those codes everywhere, not on warehouse surrogate
keys. Employee/project rows this app has never seen before naturally get a
real, new employee_id/project_code (the warehouse's own employee_code/
project_code, passed through as-is) rather than invented ones.

    allocation", not SCD-versioning) -- defaults to 1 rather than reusing
    `is_active`'s value under a name that means something different.

    `is_allocation_active` is NOT a straight passthrough of the source's own
    `is_active` bit -- confirmed against real data that it doesn't mean what
    downstream code assumes: one real employee had 288 raw allocation rows
    spanning 2021-2023, virtually all still flagged is_active=1 even though
    every date range had long since ended (it evidently just means "never
    formally cancelled," not "temporally current"). allocation_report_service.py
    sums allocation_by_percentage across every row with is_allocation_active==1

    adapter.py's not_yet_departed) rather than trusting an administrative
    flag whose real meaning turned out to be different from what the field
    name suggests.

    Tried extending "currently active" to also cover allocations with a
    matching recent (last 90 days of data) timesheet entry for the same
    employee+project, since project_allocation's own dates are stale for
    real client/internal/managed-services work (its own `updated_at` never
    moves past 2023-01-24, across all 339 employees it covers -- not just
    the dates, the whole employee population in this table froze then).
    That bridge is impossible with this data: cross-referencing confirmed
    ZERO of the 391 employees with real timesheet activity in the most
    recent 90 days of data have any row at all in project_allocation, under
    either UUID column. The two tables track two disjoint employee
    populations by this point -- project_allocation cannot be repaired into
    a "who's on client work right now" view via mapping alone; that requires
