"""Which delivery cluster each live project belongs to. A real `cluster`
column DOES exist in the fuller JDWH project-table export (260815_Tables
Schema.xlsx's `project` sheet -- confirmed live: 45 of 92 currently-active
projects carry a genuine "Cluster N" value there) and is now mapped through
by jdwh_table_mapping.map_project_table into 02_Project_Details_clean.csv's
`cluster_number` column. The remaining projects (about half) genuinely have
no cluster in the source itself -- not a mapping gap -- so a manual,
app-authored override/fallback is still needed for those, and for any new
project the wizard creates before it round-trips through a JDWH load. A
manual assignment here always wins over the real source value, so the
governance team can still correct a wrong or missing tag from the UI.
Manual storage follows the same single-row-per-project overwrite pattern as
GDPR/Budget/Kickoff, via project_appstate_service's upsert_row/get_row."""
