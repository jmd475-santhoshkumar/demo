        own top score, then re-sorts each such group by hourly rate --
        never letting cost override a real, larger difference in overall
        match quality.

        CoE preference is NOT handled here (any more) -- it's now a real,
        weighted contributor to composite_score itself (see coe_affinity_score
        in composite_score_v2), so it's already reflected in `ranked`'s order
        with no post-processing needed. It used to live in this same
        tiebreak-only pass, which correctly stopped it from overriding a real
        composite difference -- but the RM explicitly asked for CoE match to
        be able to outrank a stronger different-CoE candidate by a real
        margin, which a near-tie-only tiebreak can never do by definition.

        The _tier_key equality check is essential, not optional: `ranked` is
        sorted by a multi-field tuple (bucket/confidence/availability THEN
        composite), so composite_score is only monotonic *within* a tier --
        crossing a tier boundary (e.g. the last "observed"-confidence
        candidate to the first "imputed" one) can jump to an arbitrarily
        different composite score, including a HIGHER one. Grouping on raw
        composite proximity alone would band together candidates from
        completely different, non-comparable tiers whenever that jump
        happened to land within COST_TIE_BAND_PCT (or land below the anchor,
        since a negative gap always satisfies a `<=` check).

        A fixed rounding grid (composite_score // COST_TIE_BAND_PCT) would
        separately split two nearly identical scores -- e.g. 48.9% and 49.1%
        -- into different bands whenever they straddle a rounding boundary,
        silently disabling the tiebreak for exactly the near-ties it exists
        to catch -- hence the rolling anchor-based comparison instead."""
