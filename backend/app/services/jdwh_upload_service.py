"""Alternate real data source for the JIN Data Warehouse tables: an uploaded
Excel export instead of a live SQL connection -- for exactly the situation
the Resource Manager is in right now (no JMAN VPN on this machine, so the
live connection in jdwh_connection_service.py can't reach the server).

Feeds the SAME column-mapping (jdwh_table_mapping.map_all_tables) and the
SAME write/backup/reload step (jdwh_connection_service.write_mapped_tables)
as the live SQL path -- the only thing that differs is where the 5 real
tables' raw rows come from. This means whichever source is used, the result
is identical: this app's local employees/projects/allocations/timesheets/WSR
data gets replaced with the mapped real data.

Two upload shapes, both real (not a live query, so no MFA/VPN needed):
  - One workbook with all 6 tables as separate sheets, named exactly like
    the real tables (employee, designation_history, project,
    project_allocation, timesheet, weekly_status_report) -- e.g. the same
    shape as the jin_uat_data.ods sample the data-warehouse team already
    shared.
  - 6 separate files, one table per file (its first sheet, if it's a
    workbook with more than one).
designation_history is accepted in both shapes for consistency with the rest
of the JDWH UI (Connect's table discovery lists all 6), but genuinely unused
-- see jdwh_table_mapping.py's module docstring for why.

project_rolebased_user is a newer, optional 7th table/sheet -- when present,
it's combined with project_allocation's own rows rather than replacing them
(see jdwh_table_mapping.map_rolebased_user_table for the evidence on why
this table exists: project_allocation stopped reflecting real current
staffing on non-BAU work).
