"""AI-generated risk suggestions for the Cluster Governance view -- filling
the "Risks & Key Projects" gap for projects that have no real risk logged
yet. Uses this app's own LLM provider chain (same Azure OpenAI/Gemini/Claude
failover as sow_extraction_service.py), never hardcoded canned text.

Confirmed live: 08_WSR_Report_clean.csv's `comment` field is 100% null
across all 72,584 real rows -- JDWH currently only grants the RAG status
colors (scope/schedule/quality/csat/team_status), not narrative comments.
A separate real `risk` column (see map_wsr_table's risk_note field) IS
populated for 243 of 72,584 real rows.

Grounding rules, same posture as sow_extraction_service.py:
  - When a real risk_note exists, it is shown VERBATIM, with NO AI
    involvement at all -- real WSR content is shown as real WSR content,
    full stop. (An earlier version also asked the AI for a mitigation step
    grounded in the real note; dropped after real output showed the AI
    inventing filler -- e.g. "review the real risk note on file" -- when the
    note described something no longer actionable, like a discontinued pod.
    Better to show nothing than a plausible-sounding non-answer.)
  - Only when NO real risk_note exists is the AI used at all, generating
    BOTH the risk description and the mitigation step from the WSR RAG
    colors alone. The prompt explicitly forbids inventing project-specific
    detail that isn't in the (empty) input -- the honest output is a plain
    statement of which areas are flagged, not a fabricated narrative.
  - AI results are cached per (project, flagged-areas fingerprint) so the
    same real state is never re-sent to the AI on every page load.

"Cluster 5 stays healthy -- nearly all projects green, no red; both ambers are client-driven, not delivery"

Write 3-4 short bullet points (each one sentence, high level) that a Resource Manager can read aloud to open the discussion. Refer to projects by NAME (as given above), never by an internal code -- names are what get said out loud on a call. Do NOT invent a project, a client name, a cause, or any detail not given above. Prioritize the most severe first (Red WSR, real logged risks); if the cluster is broadly healthy, say so plainly in one point rather than manufacturing concern across several.
