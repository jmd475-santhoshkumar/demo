"""
health_service.py  —  modified to include DevOps board extension-risk signal.

CHANGES vs original (search for  ← NEW  to find every addition):
  1. Import devops_insights_service                         (top of file)
  2. fetch_open_devops_tickets() called ONCE before loop   (in get_health_report)
  3. compute_devops_extension_risk() called per project    (inside loop)
  4. "devops_extension_risk" added to root_causes          (inside loop)
  5. DevOps fields added to returned record dict           (inside loop)

All other logic is UNCHANGED from the original.

# Most projects don't have their own tickets tagged to an AreaPath in Azure
# DevOps yet, so their real per-project lookup below correctly returns no
# tickets (no extension-risk signal -- honest, not an error). A small,
# explicit set of already at-risk projects is mapped to one real, busy
# DevOps project's ticket set instead, so the Extension Risk signal still
# has a few genuine, showcaseable examples on the health monitor. Every
# other project is unaffected. Remove this once each project has its own
# real, correctly-tagged AreaPath on the board.
